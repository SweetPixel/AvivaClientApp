					<p class="black-text left-align"> The clinic from its simple humble beginnings almost forty years ago, has developed into a large multidisciplinary dental clinic, as I am very fortunate to have exceptional practitioners and staff working with me. The concept of the clinic is to offer treatment of a very high standard in every aspect of dentistry. What I hope makes this clinic special is that this is done in a very caring way, where patients needs are met. We all have different fears and needs. If you are in pain, someone will see you, if you are scared stiff, someone will be able to treat your needs. This I hope creates the right environment that is such an important part of your treatment. As you would expect this clinic has state of the art equipment. All the surgeries are fully equipped with the latest dental units and x-rays. CT scanner, cameras, lasers and microscopes in the specialists units. We have a dedicated decontamination room where all instruments are cleaned and sterilised following the HTM 01-05 document from the department of health. The clinics specialists cover every aspect of clinical dentistry. We have a specialist children's dentist, who will treat most cases at the clinic with the help of his dental therapists. The larger more difficult cases are treated in hospital in a specialist children's unit, under general anaesthetic with a children's anaesthetist. Most of our patients require "routine" dental care, ranging from hygiene, fillings, crowns and veneers. These treatments are done with care and efficiency, the technicians are part of our team and will also come to see the patient and are painstaking and efficient in their work. If you need a root canal treatment or endodontic surgery we have specialists to treat you. Similarly if your teeth are displaced or crowded the orthodontists will correct this. If there are major anatomical discrepancies the maxillofacial surgeons can undertake orthognathic surgery with startling improvements. These surgeons will also undertake the removal of troublesome wisdom teeth, cysts, check for oral cancers and all aspects of oral disease , nerve damage and neuropathy. Our periodontist and surgeons place implants. The periodontist undertakes care and provides invasive and non invasive laser surgery to improve the health of the gums and supportive tissues. The specialist prosthododntist can make removable prostheses supported by either natural teeth or implants, correct pain caused by discrepancies in the bite and the non-surgical treatment of TMD (Temporomandibular joint disease or dysfunction) The prosthodontist will also undertake major restorative treatments, partial or full mouth rehabilitations. These also include aesthetic treatments, veneers, crowns and restorations with the new ceramic materials. These treatments can transform your smile and facial appearance. All these treatments are undertaken with care and enormous attention to detail. Consultant anaesthetists also attend the clinic for patients who require sedation, the more extensive treatments are undertaken in hospital under general anaesthesia. Everything is dependent on the ability care and compassion of everyone who works for Harley Street Dental Clinic.</p>
